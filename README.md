Hello.

This project is a list, where you can add to list items, and you can check them as completed or as
deleted.
In case any special charaters are used, it will throw errors, showing user that need to enter simple data.

It is a simple project where I used for the frontend part only Bootstrap 5.2 and the backend part I used Vannila Javascript.

The backend aproach to this project, was to use arrays, and to simulate a simple list.
